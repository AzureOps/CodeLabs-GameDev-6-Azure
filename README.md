## Overview ##

Enable your game with the Azure cloud technologies. Microsoft Azure offers hundreds of cross-platform services for any device: Android, iOS and Windows. In this lab, you will use a sample game and add Azure services to it. Your app will take advantage of multiple Azure services: you can choose what services to use in your game to expand it to its full potential.

## Exercises ##
This module includes the following exercises:

1. [Save game score and settings in Azure](#Exercise1)
2. [Performing the second exercise](#Exercise2)

Estimated time to complete this module: **60 minutes**

<a name="Exercise1" />
### Exercise 1: Save game score and settings in Azure ###

Most games need to save score and settings. Wouldn’t it be great if we can save user game score on one device, say a PC and then when the user comes back to another device: his/her tablet or phone, the score is there? In this lab you’ll be able to do it and learn how to use Microsoft Azure portal.

For the purpose of this lab we use a popular Unity Tanks! tutorial game available from Unity3D Web site. Tanks! is a very nice [multiplayer game example](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/tanks-tutorial). In this code lab you’ll learn how to modify this game to add Azure functionality to the game. At any moment you can access any step of this tutorial in code. Simply look at the project folder

- StepComplete folder contains complete code of the game
- Step3_AddedGameScore source of the game with game score added

        app.UseMvc(routes =>
        {
            routes.MapRoute(
                name: "default",
                template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
