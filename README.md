## Overview ##

Enable your game with the Azure cloud services. Microsoft Azure offers hundreds of cross-platform services for any device: Android, iOS and Windows. In this lab, you will use a sample game and add Azure App Service to it. Naturally, your app can take advantage of multiple services available in Azure: you can choose what services to use in your game to expand it to its full potential. In this Lab we use Azure App Service and storage to save your score.

### Exercise 1: Create Azure App Service for your game ###

Most games need to save score and settings. Wouldn’t it be great if we can save user game score on one device, say a PC and then when the user comes back to another device: his/her tablet or phone, the score is there? In this lab you’ll be able to do it and learn how to use Microsoft Azure portal.

For the purpose of this lab we use a popular Unity Tanks! tutorial game available from Unity3D Web site. Tanks! is a very nice [multiplayer game example](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/tanks-tutorial). In this code lab you’ll learn how to modify this game to add Azure functionality to the game.

#### Task 1 - Create Azure Mobile App ####

Microsoft Azure provides hundreds of features game developers can take advantage of. One of them is Mobile Apps. 

1. If you already have an Azure account go to [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com) or you can open a free one-month trial [Free Azure One-Month Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/). Inside of the Azure portal, simply select **New | Web + Mobile | Mobile App**, which is the starting point to configure your Azure Mobile App backend.

	![Create Azure Mobile App](Images/azure-create-mobile-app.png?raw=true "Create Azure Mobile App")

2. You’ll need to provide App Service name (this is the URL where your backend will live), configure your subscription, and set your resource group and plan. You can choose location where your app to be most active:
	
	![Configure Azure Mobile App](Images/azure-create-mobile-app-details.png?raw=true "Configure Azure Mobile App")
	
3. Once deployed, the Azure portal will bring you directly to the configuration screen with the settings tab open. All of the settings we’ll adjust can be found under the Mobile section:
	
	![Configure Azure Settings](Images/azure-settings.png?raw=true "Configure Azure Settings")
	
4. Our backend data will live in a database. Under the Data Connections section, select Add, and then configure a new SQL database:
	
	![Configure Database Settings](Images/azure-db.png?raw=true "Configure Azure Database")
	
5. When the data connection is created, it will appear in the Mobile Apps data connections blade, which means it’s time to set up the data that will go in the new database. Click OK on all open blades and Azure will begin to create the database for us on the fly. When the data connection is created, it will appear in the Mobile Apps data connections blade, which means it’s time to set up the data that will go in the new database. 
	
	![Azure Database Connection](Images/azure-db-connection.png?raw=true "Azure Database Connection")
 
6. Under Mobile settings is a new section called Easy Tables, which enable us to easily set up and control the data coming to and from the iOS and Android apps. Select the Easy Tables section, and we’ll be prompted with a big blue warning asking us to configure Easy Tables/Easy APIs:
	
	![Azure Easy Tables](Images/azure-easy-tables.png?raw=true "Azure Easy Tables")

7. Since we already setup the database, the only thing left to do is Initialize the app.
	
	![Azure Initialize the App](Images/azure-init-app.png?raw=true "Azure Initialize the App")

8. When the app will be fully initialized you can add our first table of the database named GameScore. If you are adding Azure Mobile Apps to an existing application, this table name should match the class name of the data you with to store. The beautiful part of Easy Tables is that it will automatically update and add the columns in the table dynamically based on the data we pass in. For this example, I’ll simply allow full anonymous access to the table, however it is possible to add authentication with Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, and other OAuth login providers.

### Exercise 2: Save game settings and score in Azure ###

<a name="Ex2Task1" />
#### Task 1 - Open Game Project in Visual Studio ####

1. Launch Visual Studio 2015 from the Start Menu. Then, open **UnityTanksWithAzure** solution by double clicking on it. Then run the project by pressing **F5**. This should start Tanks! game as a Windows Universal app.

	![Visual Studio Solution](Images/vs-solution.png?raw=true "Visual Studio Solution") 
	
<a name="Ex2Task2" />
#### Task 2 - Add code to save game score in Azure ####

1. First you need to create a data model for Azure Mobile app. The great thing about Azure Mobile apps is that as you change your data model, backend automatically picks up the changes. In our game we’ll save user and the best score achieved during the game. Add the following code to **GameScore.cs** file in Assets\Complete\Scripts\Build16 folder:
		
	(Code Snippet - _Add code to save game score in Azure - Ex2 - GameScore.cs_)
	````C#
    public class GameScore
    {
        public string id { get; set; }

        public string user { get; set; }

        public float score { get; set; }

        public int tank { get; set; }
    }

	````

2. Next, you need to connect your game to Azure. Add the following code to **GameManager.cs** **Start** method after //BUILD16 Connect to Azure comment. Please, make sure to replace <YOUR APP SERVICE> with the name of the service you created in Azure portal:

	(Code Snippet - _Add code to save game score in Azure - Ex2 - GameManager.cs_)
	````C#
	//BUILD16 Connect to Azure
	Debug.Log("Logging into Azure...");
	AzureMobileServices.Connect("https://<YOUR APP SERVICE>.azurewebsites.net");
	````

3. Next, add the following code right after that, this will save initial score to Azure:

	(Code Snippet - _Add code to save game score in Azure - Ex2 - GameManager.cs_)
	````C#
	//BUILD16 Save initial game score in Azure
	userId = System.Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        GameScore score = new GameScore { user = userId, score = 0 };
        AzureMobileServices.Insert<GameScore>(score, (response) =>
        {
           if (response.Status == CallbackStatus.Failure)
           {
                Debug.LogError("Inserting record failed.");
                Debug.LogError(response.Exception.ToString());
                return;
           }

           // print something
           Debug.Log("Successfully inserted item " + score.id);
        });

	````
4. Each time a tank wins a round, you need to save game score in Azure App Service for that tank. You need to add this method to **GameManager.cs**. This method checks if there's a winning tank **m_RoundWinner** and saves the score for that tank in the database:

	(Code Snippet - _Add code to save game score in Azure - Ex2 - GameManager.cs_)
	````C#
	private void SaveScoreInAzure()
        {
            if (m_RoundWinner != null)
            {
                GameScore score = new GameScore { user = userId, tank = m_RoundWinner.m_PlayerNumber, score = m_RoundWinner.m_Wins };
                AzureMobileServices.Insert<GameScore>(score, (response) =>
                {
                    if (response.Status == CallbackStatus.Failure)
                    {
                        Debug.LogError("Inserting record failed.");
                        Debug.LogError(response.Exception.ToString());
                        return;
                    }

                // print something
                Debug.Log("Successfully inserted item " + score.id);
                });
            }
        }

	````

5. Lastly, you need to invoke this method each time a round ends. Go to **GameManager.cs**, find **RoundEnding** method and add a call to your **SaveScoreToAzure()** method right below where the number of wins is incremented for the player. Don't forget to put both statements in curved brackets, like so:

	(Code Snippet - _Add code to save game score in Azure - Ex2 - GameManager.cs_)
	````C#
	    // If there is a winner, increment their score.
            if (m_RoundWinner != null)
            {
                m_RoundWinner.m_Wins++;
                SaveScoreInAzure();
            }

	````
	
5. In Visual Studio you can fully debug your Unity game. Let's set a few breakpoints: in Visual Studio solution explorer navigate to **GameManager.cs**: 

	![Set Breakpoints](Images/debug-project.png?raw=true "Set Breakpoints") 
	
6. Set up a breakpoint before you call **AzureMobileServices.Insert** method: 

	![Set Breakpoints for Score](Images/debug-save-score.png?raw=true "Set Breakpoints for Score") 

	
7. Now, build and run the game by clicking **F5** in Visual Studio. After the app launches, you can see that the GameScore table you’ve just created has a new record. In Azure portal click on Game Score table:

	![Game Score Inserted](Images/azure-table-insert.png?raw=true "Game Score Inserted") 
	
8. Observe a new record added, or alternatively you can connect to the database directly from Visual Studio and check that records are inserted:

	![Game Score Inserted Record](Images/azure-insert-details.png?raw=true "Game Score Inserted Record")
